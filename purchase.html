                    <p>The Cara Jourdan Presets are finally here! After many requests and questions about just how Cara and Paige create Cara’s photos, they have worked together to create an easy to use, beautiful Preset Package.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cara Jourdan and Paige Owen have traveled the world together, creating content from Costa Rica to Mexico to Spain and everywhere in between.  As a creative team, they have developed an aesthetic for the photos they create together, and from there, have put this preset package together that they hope inspires you!
                    </p>
                    <p>Developed by Paige Owen, there are three custom made presets included in the Cara Jourdan Preset Pack for Lightroom: City, Nature and Ocean. We have also included four bonus adjustments: Bright, Colour Pop, Grain, and Sunkissed that can be added to each preset with one click.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>What is a preset?</h3>
        <p class="faqans">A preset is a template containing manual edits that have been previously made in Lightroom. They turn your original image into the same style you see on Cara Jourdan’s Instagram.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between the mobile presets and the desktop presets?</h3>
        <p class="faqans">The Lightroom Desktop Presets are meant to be used on a computer or laptop using RAW photos, whereas the mobile presets are designed to be used on your mobile device only. We recommend the mobile preset pack for those who mostly edit on their phones as the mobile pack does not work on computers. If you are looking for presets to use with your Adobe Lightroom Classic CC subscription, we recommend purchasing the Lightroom Presets for Desktop.</p>
        <h3>What do I need in order to use the presets?</h3>
        <p class="faqans">You will need the Adobe Lightroom Classic CC installed on your desktop or laptop computer.</p>
        <h3>Do these presets work on every photo?</h3>
        <p class="faqans">These presets process your photos beautifully when applied and are easy to use. Every photo, however, is different, so these presets will vary on each photo depending on the lighting, camera gear, composition, etc. There are so many factors that determine how a preset will look  on each photo, so we encourage you to make them your own by playing around with different adjustments. You can start by adding our one-click adjustments included with the presets, and go from there. Minor adjustments can make a huge difference!</p>
        <h3>What will I receive with my purchase? </h3>
        <p class="faqans">You will receive three preset files: City, Nature, and Ocean, as well as the four bonus adjustments for your presets: Brighten, Colour Pop, Grain, and Sunkissed. The presets and bonus adjustments will all work for your desktop Lightroom Program. You will also receive a PDF Guide with installation instructions.</p>
        <h3>What happens after I purchase the presets? </h3>
        <p class="faqans">Once purchased, you will automatically receive an order confirmation email, followed by an email containing a link to the file. This link will expire 24 hours after it's first clicked, so make sure you get it downloaded! If you do no receive an email, make sure you entered the correct email address and check your junk folder. If you’re having troubles downloading from the link provided, try using another internet browser.</p>
