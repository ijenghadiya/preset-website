                    <p>The Cara Jourdan Presets are finally here! After many requests and questions about just how Cara and Paige create Caraâ€™s photos, they have worked together to create an easy to use, beautiful Preset Package.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cara Jourdan and Paige Owen have traveled the world together, creating content from Costa Rica to Mexico to Spain and everywhere in between.  As a creative team, they have developed an aesthetic for the photos they create together, and from there, have put this preset package together that they hope inspires you!
                    </p>
                    <p>Developed by Paige Owen, there are three custom made presets included in the Cara Jourdan Preset Pack for Lightroom: City, Nature and Ocean. We have also included four bonus adjustments: Bright, Colour Pop, Grain, and Sunkissed that can be added to each preset with one click.
